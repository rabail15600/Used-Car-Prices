# Used Car Prices
 
Data description:
A Chinese automobile company, named Geely Auto, is targeting the US market to set up a manufacturing
unit and compete with their US and European counterparts. Since the dynamics of the American market can
be very different in comparison with the Chinese market, they have contracted with an automobile consulting
company to provide insights. Basically, they are looking for the factors that are significant in predicting the
price of a car in the US. Therefore, the automobile consulting firm has gathered a large dataset of different
types of cars across the American market. The data file carprices.csv has information on 205 cars, and p =
24 predictors that may help explain changes in price.
